# Morphological Operations on Fingerprint Image

## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code and resources for performing morphological operations on fingerprint images. Morphological operations are essential in image processing for tasks such as noise removal, image enhancement, and feature extraction, especially in biometric applications like fingerprint analysis.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Read and display fingerprint images.
- **Morphological Operations**: Implement dilation, erosion, opening, closing, and boundary extraction.
- **Visualization**: Compare original and processed images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (R2018a or later recommended)
- Image Processing Toolbox

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tusharprabhu/Morphological-Operations-on-Fingerprint-Image.git
```

Open MATLAB and add the project folder to your path:

```matlab
addpath('Morphological-Operations-on-Fingerprint-Image')
```

### Usage

1. Place your fingerprint images in the project directory.
2. Run the main script (e.g., `main.m`, or specify the script name if different).
3. Follow the prompts or modify parameters as needed.

Example:

```matlab
fingerprint_img = imread('sample_fingerprint.jpg');
processed_img = imclose(fingerprint_img, strel('disk', 3));
imshow(processed_img);
```

## File Structure

- `/images/` — Sample fingerprint images
- `/scripts/` — MATLAB scripts for morphological operations
- `main.m` — Main script to run the workflow
